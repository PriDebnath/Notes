Contributing to Notes
=====================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Notes!
This document is aimed at developers and contributors who want to work on the project.


Project Structure
-----------------

- Root
  - `backend`   – Bun/TypeScript backend (database, API, migrations)
  - `frontend`  – Vite + React frontend (Quotes Keeper UI)
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` – Monorepo configuration


Frontend (Vite + React)
-----------------------

Main tech stack:

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- @tanstack/router for routing
- @tanstack/react-query for data fetching and caching
- Dexie / IndexedDB for local quote and tag storage
- Styled UI components, theming, and backgrounds for a pleasant reading experience


Running the Frontend Locally
----------------------------

1. Install pnpm if you do not have it:
   - https://pnpm.io/installation

2. Install dependencies (from the repo root):

   - `cd frontend`
   - `pnpm install`

3. Start the development server:

   - `pnpm dev`

4. Open the app in your browser (Vite will print the URL, usually http://localhost:5173).


Building & Deployment (Frontend)
--------------------------------

- The app is configured to build with Vite:

  - `cd frontend`
  - `pnpm run build`

- The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy_frontend_to_pages.yml` builds the frontend
  and deploys the contents of `frontend/dist` to GitHub Pages.

- A `last-deployed.json` file is injected during the build and can be read by the app to show
  the last deployment time in the UI.


Backend
-------

- The `backend` folder contains a Bun/TypeScript API with Drizzle ORM and migrations.
- You can inspect `backend/package.json` for available scripts (dev, build, etc.) and run them with Bun or pnpm,
  depending on your setup.


Code Style & Guidelines
------------------------

- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer hooks and stores that are already in use (`frontend/src/hook`, `frontend/src/store`).
- Follow existing naming conventions for files and components.
- Run linting/formatting tools if configured before opening a pull request.
