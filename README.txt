Notes
=====

**Turn scattered notes into a personal library you actually want to revisit.**

Most note apps become a graveyard: you capture ideas, quotes, and thoughts, and never see them again.
Notes is built to make your notes feel like a beautifully designed collection you enjoy browsing,
not a dusty archive you forget about.


What makes it different?
------------------------

- **Cards that invite reading**: Notes are shown as warm, tactile cards instead of flat lists,
  so even old notes feel fresh when you scroll past them.
- **Backgrounds and moods**: Switch between subtle textures and themes so your workspace feels
  more like a desk you enjoy sitting at than a plain white screen.
- **Focus on the words, not the UI**: The interface gets out of the way so your notes – quotes,
  thoughts, drafts – are the star of the page.
- **Organized without being overwhelming**: Tags, filters, and sorting are there when you need them,
  but they don’t scream for attention when you just want to read.
- **Fast and local-first**: Notes load instantly and feel responsive, even with a growing collection.


Perfect for
-----------

- **Readers** who highlight everything and want a beautiful place to keep the best lines.
- **Writers and creators** who collect ideas, hooks, and snippets to reuse later.
- **Thinkers and journalers** who want a calmer, more delightful space for short notes.


How it feels to use
-------------------

- You open the app and immediately see a wall of cards that feels curated, not cluttered.
- You scroll and rediscover things you had forgotten you saved – like browsing a shelf of favorite books.
- Changing the background or theme feels like rearranging your desk, not configuring software.


Try it
------

- Open the app, add a single quote or thought that matters to you, and see how it looks on a card.
- Tag a few notes and play with different views to find a layout that matches your mood.
- Come back tomorrow and notice how easy it is to fall back into reading what you’ve saved.
